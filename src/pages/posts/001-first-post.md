Hi! Welcome to my personal website. I hope you like what I'm writing about. I would like to focus on issues related to the world of frontend.  I will also share personal reflections from the IT world and report on what I am currently working on and what problems I am facing. I believe that what you find here will be at least a little valuable and you will find what you are looking for here.
